# Eremos

**Autonomous swarm agents for early on-chain signal detection.**  
Eremos is a lightweight framework for deploying modular agents that monitor blockchain activity — tracking wallet clusters, mint patterns, and contract anomalies.  
Built for devs who want low-noise, early signals embedded into their workflow or protocol stack.

## Features

- **Agent Architecture** — Create custom agents with scoped detection logic  
- **Signal Emission** — Structured alerts for downstream action or UI display  
- **Modular Design** — Extend with new watchers, memory logs, or lightweight inference modules  
- **Chain Awareness** — Built for early signal capture and behavioral tracing
